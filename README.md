# Repository Structure
- `code/new` contains the newest code that was hosted on Google Colab.
  - This is the entirety of all the code I have.
  - Please download the code through this repo instead of attemping to access the code hosted on Google Colab.
  - Minor changes were made to the code on Tuesday night that I am unaware of in the last few code blocks, overwriting previous code I had written.
  - There may be runtime errors that I've attempted to fix.
  - However, in the interest of time, I did not get the opportunity to run that code block to ensure it works.
- `report` contains the `.tex` files used to generate the `report.pdf` file.
  - This is the entirety of all the markdown and PDF report I have.
  - Please download the markdown and PDF report through this repo instead of attemping to access the code hosted on Overleaf.
