This repository contains the code for the CSC494 project completed by Alessandro Marmi under the supervision of Professor Peter Marbach.



In this repository we examine collaborative systems among agents within the framework of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We use the Orchard Environment to run our experiments.
